# üõ°Ô∏è Security Review Portfolio üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to my Security Review Portfolio repository! This repository is where I keep track of all the findings from security audits I've conducted.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find PDF files containing detailed reports of security audits I've carried out on various projects, systems, and applications. Each report provides a comprehensive analysis of the security posture of the audited entity, including identified vulnerabilities, risks, and recommendations for improvement.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the projects or systems reviewed. Each folder contains PDF files corresponding to specific audits. Here's how it's structured:

- **[Project/System Name]/**: Top-level folders for each project or system reviewed.
  - **[Audit Date]/**: Subfolders for audits conducted on specific dates.
    - **Audit_Report.pdf**: Detailed report outlining the findings and recommendations.

Feel free to navigate through the folders to access the audit reports and related documentation.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a record of my own security audits, I'm open to collaboration and feedback. If you have suggestions for improvement or would like to discuss security findings, feel free to reach out or create a pull request.
